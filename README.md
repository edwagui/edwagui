A Little Introduction

Name's Edward. I'm a college student taking IT.

Taking this program seems like the right way to go for my future.

I don't really have a destination so I'm letting life take me where it wants to go.

I like to explore places and go outside.

It gives me inspiration for the building video games that I play.

Right now, I'm learning how to use Git and GitHub right as a part of my web course.
